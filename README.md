When adding a workout, users can choose between a cardio or resistance workout type and name it whatever they like. If choosing a cardio workout they can set distance and duration, and if choosing a resistance workout, can set weight, sets, reps, and duration.

After hitting complete, the user is returned to the main page where their logged workout's stats are posted. Selecting "Dashboard" takes them to a page that logs their workout duration and weight on a graph and lists it chronologically for tracking purposes.
